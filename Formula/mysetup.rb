# Homebrew formula for the mysetup CLI. Rendered for each release by
# engine/scripts/release-manifest.ts from engine/packaging/homebrew/mysetup.rb.in in

# It installs the signed, notarised macOS universal binary (or the static Linux binary)
# from mysetup.ai. There is deliberately no `service` block: background operation is
# opt-in through `mysetup service enable`, which registers the version-independent
# opt/ path, so `brew services` and our agent never both start a host.

      Get started:

        mysetup onboard

      Sign in, choose your skills and connect another device.
      Nothing is published, and background sync stays off until you turn it on.

      After upgrading:      mysetup service restart
      Before uninstalling:  mysetup auth logout, then mysetup self uninstall
                            (your skills are never removed)

      All commands: mysetup help
    EOS
  end

    assert_match "\"ok\":true", shell_output("#{bin}/mysetup doctor --offline --json")
    assert_match "\"installed\":false", shell_output("#{bin}/mysetup service status --json")
